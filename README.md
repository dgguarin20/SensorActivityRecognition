# SensorActivityRecognition

### At the folder named 'proyecto': there is 3 python files to run. One is Train5_TestNatural, TrainSplit_Train4Test5, Train_Graph and temp_conHiperparametros. 

### For The first file is just a test with doing the activities normally and training it with the other 5 tests. The second file is chekcing if the split is overfitting and checking what happens if a test is an user. For Train Graph, is script that shows, a contrast between the predict label and the measure label. Finally the last file is using the hyperparameterrs to figure out the correct parameters at using random forest.
